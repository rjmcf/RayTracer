# RayTracer
This is a ray tracing implementation currently supporting multiple coloured lights, multiple coloured objects, and shadows. 

Updates should include reflectivity, refraction and some imaging effects like depth of field, motion blur etc. Improvements to the user interface will hopefully be made, and real time updates of the scene with respect to moving the camera and adding objects/lights may be forthcoming.
