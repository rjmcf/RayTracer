# RayTracer
This is a very simple graphics package.

In the "for3D" folder we have a ray tracing implementation currently supporting multiple coloured lights, multiple coloured objects, and shadows. 

Updates should include reflectivity, refraction and some imaging effects like depth of field, motion blur etc. Improvements to the user interface will hopefully be made, and real time updates of the scene with respect to moving the camera and adding objects/lights may be forthcoming.

In the "for2D" folder we have a line and curve drawing application capable of drawing straight lines and Bezier curves. Bezier curves can also have the convex hull of the control points shown to demonstrate that property. Currently drawing near-vertical sections of Bezier curves is buggy.

Pictures generated of the line drawing are shown below the 3D examples.
